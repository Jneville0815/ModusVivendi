# Status Report (STATUS.md)

Team: #7 - Modus Vivendi <br>
Members: Jimmy Neville, Dustin Craig, Kishan Patel, Chandler Lampe <br>

## Introduction
Modus Vivendi is a fitness web application.

We have accomplished a login page, registration page, workout page, and diet page.

We didn’t have to make changes from our previous plan.

Our future goal is to set up a database so we can store user information and pull it off from a database. 

## Customer Value
No changes.

## Technology
As of right now, for the client side we are using the basic web stack (HTML, JS, CSS) along with the ReactJS library. In addition to this, we are utilizing Bootstrap and ReactStrap to handle the styling. On the server side, we are using ExpressJS which is a barebones version of NodeJS. <em>Screenshot of working example (workout portion):</em> <br> <br>

Kishan Patel: Junior Computer Science student with no experience outside of school but I have little experience in JavaScript. Trying to learn new technologies and languages. Over this iteration Kishan has been working on developing and styling the login page.

## Project Management 
The project is still on schedule as planned. No updates have been needed throughout the semester. Our team has been working well together and working ahead to make sure each iteration is complete on or before its due date.

## Reflection 
Overall, This iteration went well and has a good amount of functionality. Writing the code for the UI was challenging because the pages did not look the same. In the next iteration we will look for a more complex UI and a more complete log-in policy.
