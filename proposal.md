## Introduction 
Modus Vivendi is a fitness web application.
<br>

The motivation for doing this project was primarily an interest in undertaking a challenging project in an interesting area of learning a new language and the opportunity to gain experience.

Our app features both food plans and workout plans.

Our team members have experience in JavaScript and CSS. The challenging part of the project will be storing the user information on the database. 


## Customer Value 
The targeted customers are the ones that are looking to lose weight, better their exercise plans, or just get into healthy habits. The reason this app is necessary is because most apps either focus on one area: food plans or work out plans. This app will be unique to the market because it will focus on both equally. Focusing on both allows our customers to cut down on apps they use and paves the way for a better fitness program. <br>

We will know that our app is successful by seeing that customers are constantly tracking food and exercise through are app and for customers that are looking to lose weight, to see their weight to go on a downward trend in conjunction of using our app. 

## Proposed Solution & Technology
As mentioned above, our fitness app will combine the benefits of tracking macros and physical fitness in a way that’s user friendly and efficient. The application will develop workout plans and macros that assist the user in obtaining their current fitness/weight loss goals. The technologies we will use to deliver the application are React, MongoDB, Express and Node.js. React is a front-end library that uses JSX to build user interfaces. MongoDB is a cross-platform database program that we will use to store data. Express is a web application server framework for Node.js, and Node.js is a server-side environment that executes Javascript code outside of the browser. This stack is commonly referred to as the MERN stack, and it provides the tools and libraries needed to develop a high-quality full-stack web application.<br>

We will first develop a minimal system that provides the front-end of our application and the numerous algorithms that will compute the fitness/weight loss plans. After the minimal system is created we will then develop an authentication system and a back-end to store user data. 

## Team 
Dustin Craig: Junior Computer Science student with 1 ½ years experience with software development outside of school using various web technologies. 

Kishan Patel: Junior Computer Science student with no experience outside of school but I have little experience in JavaScript. Trying to learn new technologies and languages.

Chandler Lampe: Junior Computer Science Major. I have no outside coding experience but I do have my own marketing company that I look forward to growing with my coding knowldege.  

Jimmy Neville: Junior Computer Science student. Experience using python and javascript with several different technologies centered around data analysis and web development.

## Project Management
#### Overview 
Completion of the system is very attainable due to our experience and product scope.
We will meet face to face at least every class period and if needed we are all willing to meet outside of class time. Since we are taking a modular approach to the implementation of the product, members will be able to work independently of each other most of the time.

#### Schedule
2/03 -> 2/10: work on implementation of a minimum viable product and submit iteration 1 status report. 

2/10 -> 2/17: iteratively improve minimum viable product and have a basis for how the backend will work. 

2/17 -> 2/24: submit iteration 2 status report and continue to work on the architecture of the application.

2/14 -> 3/2: begin testing(automated and user based) and heavily focus on front end look and feel

3/2 -> 3/9: submit iteration 3 status report

3/9 -> 3/16: finish up product

3/16 -> 4/3: complete all aspects of product implementation, write project report and present final product. 

#### Constraints
We should not run into any regulatory or legal constraints since we will be using the technologies within the scope of their respective licenses. 

We are not worried about any ethical or social concerns.

#### Resources
All required technologies of the product are easily attainable and we will have access to everything we need to produce the product. 

We may try to find a database of foods and their nutritional value but if we can not, the user can implement their own food/nutrition statistics.

#### Descoping 
If the full product as described above can not be implemented we will be able to cut out chunks(food database/workout predictor details/diet plans etc) until we can fit the time frame. If we have to make cuts to the product, it will only be to parts that enhance the functionality.

Our product’s minimum viable product will still be useful.
